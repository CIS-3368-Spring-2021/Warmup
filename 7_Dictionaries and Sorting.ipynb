    "\n",
    "We have seen several compound types: i.e.  lists and strings. These group together\n",
    "multiple elements and are all sequence types, i.e. they are inherently ordered. A Python dictionary is another compound type, however it is inherently not ordered but it is instead a mapping type. The essential purpose of a dictionary is very simple: to associate *keys* and *values*. Keys can be strings (e.g. **\"bill\"**), or numbers (e.g. **55**), or even tuples (e.g. the tuple **'(\"bill\",\"bryson\")')**, but **not** ordinary lists. The stored values may be any Python value; strings and numbers are common cases. A key can be paired with *at most one* value, i.e. if we assign a new value to a key, its previous value is lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by trying out some simple operations with the Python interpreter. You can create an *empty* dictionary by assigning the value '{}'. This is illustrated in the example below, which also shows cases of assigning a value to a new key, and of assigning a new value to an existing key. Study the example thoroughly, and be sure you understand each step. When you've done so, try creating a dictionary of your own, to store phone numbers for a few people you know."

To count the number of words shared, we can simply iterate over one dictionary (i.e. using a **for**-loop), and for each word test its presence in the second dictionary (running a count of the words found in both). We can find out how many words there are in a single dictionary by using the **len** function (e.g. so \"len(d)\" returns the number of keys in dictionary **d**). If we simply add together the sizes of the two dictionaries, then we end up counting those words that appear in both dictionaries *twice*. However, we can correct for this by *subtracting* our count of the words in the overlap. Thus, if our dictionaries **d1** and **d2** share **N** words, then our similarity score would be **\"N / (len(d1) + len(d2) - N)\"** (taking care about integer division).\n",
