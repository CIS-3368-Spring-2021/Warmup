Using meaningful variable names makes your code much more readable and understandable, and is a key feature of good programming style. It not only helps someone else to understand your code (e.g. me, if I'm marking it), it also helps **you** understand your own code, which is vital if you're trying to figure out why it doesn't work, or does something that you're not expecting. Note that variable names can contain letters, digits and underscores (i.e. _), but must begin with a letter. Note also that there are some special words, Python's keywords, that cannot be used as variable names."

You won't be able to see the difference when entering print commands to the interpreter, but the difference matters when you have multiple print statements in a code file.
